# openai-eoq

This repo contains the result of a `End of Quarter` project from [SD42](https://sd42.nl/).
It is a short two-day sprint to create something, this time around anything based around the OpenAI GPT4.0 API.

All authors can be found in the commit log.

Our result was a minecraft datapack and server-side Python program that allows you to let GPT4 interact with the minecraft world through input from chat and sending commands.
It is very *very* laggy, this is an artifact of the datapack needing to be reloaded every few seconds and can't be solved in the current version.
